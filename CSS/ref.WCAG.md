# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

## introduction

**The <i>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</i> are part of a series of web accessibility guidelines published by the <i>Web Accessibility initiative (WAi)</i> of the <i>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</i>, the main international standards organization for the internet. They are a set of recommendations for making Web content more accessible, primarily for people with disabilitiesâ€”but also for all user agents, including highly limited devices, such as mobile phones. The current version, <i>WCAG 2.1</i>, was published in June 2018. The guidelines are organized under four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust <b>(POUR)</b>. Each guideline has testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.**

**The guidelines are not specific to any technology, but generally are written to be broadly applicable to all web technologies, including future technologies. The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web "content" generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including natural information such as text, images, and sounds, and code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.**

### Principles of WCAG

1. <b>Perceivable: </b> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

2. <b>Operable:</b> User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. <b>Understandable:</b> Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
4. <b>Robust:</b> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Contrast (1.4.3)

**The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:**

-   <b>Large Text:</b> Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;

-   <b>Incidental:</b> Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
-   <b>Logotypes:</b> Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.
-   <b>Essential:</b> Text that is part of an active user interface component has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
-   <b>Enhanced:</b> Text that is part of an active user interface component has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
-   <b>Minimum:</b> The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
-   <b>Enhanced:</b> The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1.
